#### 2D TRANSFORMATION USING C GRAPHICS
#### *This project was a part of my computer graphics course in Vth semester*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### About Project
Basic tranformation function for any 2D figure includes but is not limited to :
-	SCALING : increase or decrease the size of the 2D figure using the input ratio.
- 	ROTATION : rotation of the 2d figure with one of the vertex as its axis.
-	TRANSLATION	: moving the 2D figure in any direction by manipulating the x' and y' co-ordinates where (x',y') differ from (x,y) by an integer value.

This project is an effort to cover the aforementioned basic functions using the 
graphics.c library in C.
