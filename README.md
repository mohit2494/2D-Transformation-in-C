# 2D TRANSFORMATION USING C GRAPHICS
# THIS PROJECT WAS A PART OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS PROJECT SUBMISSION

* BASIC TRANSFORMATION FUNCTIONS FOR ANY TWO DIMENSIONAL FIGURE , INCLUDE :
		*	SCALING : SCALING THE FIGURE ACCORDING TO THE INPUT RATIO
		* 	ROTATION : ROTATING THE FIGURE WITH ONE VERTICE AS THE AXIS
		*	TRANSLATION	: MOVING THE 2D OBJECT ACROSS THE GRID

* THIS PROJECT COVERS BASIC SCALING, TRANSLATION, ROTATION WITH REFLECTION ACROSS X=Y , X , Y
* THIS PROJECT WORKS ON A PRE-DEFINED TRIANGLE ABC
